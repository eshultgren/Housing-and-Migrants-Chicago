										Operation Lone Star Boosts Local Border Security Efforts, Ramps Up Law Enforcement Capabilities

          Press Release
        
      
    
    Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to more than 274,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 16,900 criminal arrests, with more than 14,200 felony charges reported. More than 5,700 weapons and more than $43 million in currency have been seized. 

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:

Governor Abbott Authorizes Texas National Guard, Texas Department Of Public Safety To Return Illegal Immigrants To Border

Governor Abbott issued an executive order on Thursday, July 7 authorizing and empowering the Texas National Guard and DPS to apprehend illegal immigrants who illegally cross the border between ports of entry and return them to the border. This executive order comes after the Biden Administration's decision to end Title 42 expulsions and the Remain-in-Mexico policy, leading to historic levels of illegal crossings. 5,000 migrants were apprehended over the July 4th weekend, creating a border crisis that has overrun communities along the border and across Texas.




Governor Abbott Announces Additional $30 Million In Grants To Boost Local Border Security Efforts 

On Wednesday, July 6, Governor Abbott announced that his Public Safety Office (PSO) is providing an additional $30 million in Operation Lone Star grant funding for Texas cities and counties to enhance border security operations, including funding to help deter and interdict criminal activity related to the border crisis. This funding is part of the $100 million Operation Lone Star Grant Program funded by the legislature and launched by the Governor in September 2021.

In an interview with David Asman on Fox Business, Former Acting Director of ICE Tom Homan slammed the Biden Administration for attacking the State of Texas for stepping up in the federal government's absence to secure the border and protect communities. "Governor Abbott has done more to secure our border and not only defend Texas, but defend the United States," said Former Acting Director Homan. "Governor Abbott is a hero."
