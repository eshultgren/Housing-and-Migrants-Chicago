										Operation Lone Star Transports Over 900 Migrants To Nation’s Capital, Continues Joint Border Security Efforts With Mexican Governors

          Press Release
        
      
    
    Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry. 

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, multi-agency efforts have led to more than 246,000 migrant apprehensions, along with more than 15,000 criminal arrests — and more than 12,400 felony charges. Over 4,800 weapons and over $38 million in currency have been seized. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 344 million lethal doses throughout the state.

As part of the response to President Biden's reckless decision to end Title 42 expulsions this month, which his own administration has estimated will lead to 18,000 illegal crossings per day, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to charter buses to transport migrants from Texas border communities to Washington, D.C. Since launching this busing operation a month ago, a total of 35 buses have transported 922 migrants.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR: 

Governor Abbott Recognizes National Fentanyl Awareness Day

Governor Abbott recognized National Fentanyl Awareness Day earlier this week and highlighted Operation Lone Star's success in seizing over 344 million lethal doses of fentanyl - enough doses to kill every American. The Governor reaffirmed Texas' commitment to stopping the flow of drugs from coming into the United States thanks to President Biden's inaction to secure the border.




READ: ANALYSIS: Greg Abbott's New Border Strategy Works

"Governor Abbott, to his credit, has remained steadfast amid the criticism and even left the door open to further, expanded inspection orders if his Mexican counterparts refuse to follow through on their commitments," writes Collin Pruett with The American Conservative. "He’s proving that states can fight back against border lawlessness and win, even in the face of international political and business interests."

This specialized maritime unit can patrol in shallow water furthering the Guard’s reach on the Rio Grande.
