										Operation Lone Star Constructs More Border Wall To Deter Illegal Entry
								
						
			
		
	
October 13, 2023 | Austin, Texas 
      |
        
          Press Release
        
      
    
    Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 476,200 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 35,100 criminal arrests, with more than 32,000 felony charges reported. In the fight against the fentanyl crisis, Texas law enforcement has seized over 432 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Texas has also bused:

Over 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022
	Over 20,000 migrants to New York City since August 2022
	Over 15,000 migrants to Chicago since August 2022
	Over 3,200 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022
	Over 3,900 migrants to Denver since May 18
	Over 980 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden’s open border policies.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:

Governor Abbott: Texas Works Day And Night To Build Our Own Border Wall

Governor Abbott: Texans Must Join The Fight Against Fentanyl Crisis

This inaugural Fentanyl Poisoning Awareness Month in Texas, the Governor urges all Texans to learn the signs of fentanyl poisonings and how to help prevent more deaths.

Governor Abbott signed a law earlier this year designating October as Fentanyl Poisoning Awareness Month in Texas.
