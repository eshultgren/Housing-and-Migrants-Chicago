										Operation Lone Star Mission Expands As Biden Ends Title 42 Expulsions
								
						
			
		
	
April 8, 2022 | Austin, Texas

          Press Release
        
      
    
    Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry in response to the federal government's unwillingness to address the border crisis.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, multi-agency efforts have led to more than 225,000 migrant apprehensions, along with more than 13,300 criminal arrests — and more than 10,700 felony charges. Over 3,600 weapons and almost $30 million in currency have been seized. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 297 million lethal doses throughout the state.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

Governor Abbott announced on Wednesday aggressive actions by the State of Texas to secure the border in the wake of President Biden's decision to end Title 42 expulsions.

DPS and the Texas Military Department (TMD) are preparing additional boat blockades, deploying razor-wire at low-water crossings and high-traffic areas, and installing container blockades to stem the flow of illegal crossings. Additionally, all DPS troopers and specially trained Texas National Guard soldiers will be given riot gear in case of violence among caravans and migrants.
