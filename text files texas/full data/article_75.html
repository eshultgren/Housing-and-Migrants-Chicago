										Operation Lone Star Turns Back Over 22,000 Migrants, Prepares For Growing Migrant Caravans

          Press Release
        
      
    
    Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.

Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to more than 265,500 migrant apprehensions and more than 16,400 criminal arrests, with more than 13,800 felony charges reported. More than 5,400 weapons and almost $42 million in currency have been seized. Additionally, law enforcement have turned back more than 22,000 migrants from crossing the border.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

"We know elements of the caravans are disbanding to some extent, but smaller groups of migrants are still headed straight to our border crossings,” said Governor Abbott. “The National Guard and DPS are conducting mass-migration rehearsals to implement flexible strategies to deter illegal crossings at any point along the border where they occur."
