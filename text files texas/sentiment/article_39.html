Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 387,000 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 30,400 criminal arrests, with more than 28,500 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law enforcement has seized over 421 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden's open border policies.
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:
GOVERNOR ABBOTT: Biden's Open Border Policies Threaten U.S. National Security
Yesterday, Governor Abbott slammed President Biden's open border policies, calling the President's refusal to secure the border a threat to national security. In a tweet, the Governor pointed to a story by Fox News about the release of a migrant from federal custody whose identity appeared on the FBI’s terror watch list.
"Biden's reckless open border policies led to the release of a TERRORIST on the watch list," said Governor Abbott. "Biden is putting U.S. national security at risk."

Texas National Guard Clears Dense Brush To Improve Border Security Operations 
Texas National Guard engineers from Special Reaction Teams 2 and 3 completed Operation Alcatraz, a project to secure a section of the border along the Rio Grande River in Eagle Pass. The engineers cleared dense brush from the edge of the river where migrants use bamboo and brambles to evade capture.

WATCH: Spc. Kyle Reimer Describes Dangers Of Human Smugglers On Roadways
Texas National Guard Specialist Kyle Reimer, a team leader for Task Force Center Alpha Company in Laredo, describes the dangers of human smugglers on roadways as they attempt to transport illegal immigrants from Mexico into Texas.
"With Title 42 being up, they're more prone to break the laws of the road," said Spc. Reimer. "They'll run red lights, they'll swerve around people, they'll hit people if they need to get out of the way in order to get these migrants that they pick up across. Getting them off the street is probably the best feeling. Them driving recklessly puts a lot of people at risk. A lot of my guys have almost gotten hit and that's an issue, so having them off the road helps us feel safer, and it helps the town feel safer."
