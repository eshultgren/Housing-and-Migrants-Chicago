Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.
 
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 485,700 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 36,800 criminal arrests, with more than 33,400 felony charges reported.

 Governor Abbott, President Trump Serve Thanksgiving Meals To Service Members
 
Governor Abbott and the 45th President of the United States Donald J. Trump on Sunday thanked and served meals to over 240 Texas National Guard soldiers, DPS troopers, and other service members stationed on the border over Thanksgiving for Operation Lone Star (OLS) in Edinburg.
 
“Texas is forever grateful for our brave service members who work day and night to protect and defend our state and our nation,” said Governor Abbott. “This Thanksgiving as they are away from their families and loved ones, may we remember the sacrifices these brave men and women in uniform make every day to ensure the safety and security of all Texans and Americans.”
 
Prior to serving meals with President Trump, Governor Abbott received a briefing on OLS vehicles and border security assets Texas deployed to stem the flood of illegal immigration, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and dangerous weapons pouring into Texas from Mexico.
