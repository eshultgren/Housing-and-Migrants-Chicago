          Press Release
        
      
    
Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry. 
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star (OLS), multi-agency efforts have led to more than 242,000 migrant apprehensions, along with more than 14,000 criminal arrests — and more than 12,000 felony charges. Over 4,700 weapons and over $38 million in currency have been seized. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 344 million lethal doses throughout the state.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.
