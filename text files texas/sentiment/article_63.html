 VIDEO: Governor Abbott Gives Update On Texas Border Wall, Operation Lone Star
 
Last week, Governor Abbott spoke exclusively with Breitbart News in Eagle Pass on the steps Texas is taking to secure the border and build the wall. The Governor discussed the state's acquisition of border wall panels from the federal government, the terrifying impact of the border crisis on Texas landowners along the border, the fentanyl crisis, and more.
 
“We've apprehended enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child in Texas, and fentanyl is the leading cause of death in the United States for people between the age of 18 and 45⁠—not COVID-19, not cancer, not car wrecks, not guns⁠—it’s fentanyl," said Governor Abbott. "In Texas, more than 1,300 people lost their lives over the past year because of fentanyl. There are lives that have been lost because of the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border, and conversely there are lives that have been saved by the all of the fentanyl and other drugs we’ve seized through Operation Lone Star."
DPS Apprehends 62 Migrants Following Tanker Truck Pursuit in South Texas
 
A man is facing charges after leading DPS troopers and other law enforcement on a vehicle pursuit through two South Texas counties.
 
On the evening of March 11, 2022, a white Kenworth truck tractor towing a tanker bypassed a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint on U.S. 83 in Webb County. Border Patrol initiated a pursuit, but the driver of the tanker refused to stop. As part of Operation Lone Star, DPS Troopers took over the pursuit, which went into the city of Cotulla in La Salle County.
 
Inside the tanker, Troopers located 62 migrants who were being smuggled into the U.S.; none were injured. All were referred back to U.S. Border Patrol. The 41-year-old male driver of the truck is a U.S. citizen with a criminal history that includes human smuggling. Charges are likely. A DPS Trooper was also injured in the incident. He has since been treated and released from Frio Regional Hospital in Pearsall.
