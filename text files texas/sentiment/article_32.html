          Press Release
        
      
    
Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 384,000 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 29,000 criminal arrests, with more than 28,000 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law enforcement has seized over 419 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden's open border policies.

WATCH: DPS Lt. Olivarez Details Children Abandoned By Cartel In Sweltering Heat
DPS Lt. Christopher Olivarez joined Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo where he slammed the Biden Administration's claims of humanely handling immigration along the southern border. During the interview, Lt. Olivarez detailed the exploitation of children by Mexican cartels and human smugglers, noting that DPS rescued 10 children who were abandoned in the extreme heat along the river bank in Eagle Pass earlier this week.
"They talk about having a humane process," said Lt. Olivarez. "But as you see in the video, nothing is humane about having children being left at the river, especially during the summer heat right now."

Texas National Guard Apprehends, Turns Back Illegal Immigrants
This week, Texas National Guard soldiers assisted DPS troopers in the apprehension of a driver and three illegal immigrants after a high-speed pursuit in a Laredo neighborhood that ended when the vehicle broke down. DPS Brush Teams had received a call regarding a group of people speeding off in what is known as a “load-up vehicle.”
The following day in another incident, Operation Lone Star partners apprehended one female illegal immigrant as four males swam back to Mexico after a high-speed pursuit that ended when the vehicle drove into the Rio Grande River.
Texas National Guard soldiers have witnessed the many different ways illegal immigrants try to get across the border. “We had a few that we turned back in a raft early,” said Spc. Crumby. “Late in the shift, there was another group nearer to the bank, and we were able to turn them back too.”
