Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 447,800 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 34,200 criminal arrests, with more than 31,200 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law enforcement has seized over 428 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden's open border policies.
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:
WATCH: Governor Abbott Says State Will Fight Biden's 'Remain In Texas' Policy
With the Biden Administration considering forcing some migrants to remain in Texas, Governor Abbott told Fox News this week that the State of Texas will not let this policy be carried out.
“This is a day of reckoning for the United States to realize the liberal policies of open borders will not work in this country,” said Governor Abbott. “The [remain in Texas] policy should be one mile further across the Rio Grande. It should be 'Remain in Mexico,' not 'Remain in Texas.' That policy has been tried in the past, and it was legally stricken down. We have a lawsuit ready to go that will eliminate this threat by Joe Biden if he dares try to pull the trigger on it.”
Governor Abbott: Texas Is Adding More Border Wall In Del Rio Sector
 Governor Abbott this week highlighted Texas’ continued work to construct new border wall in the Del Rio sector to provide Texans with the support and protection they need and deserve amid President Biden's border crisis.
WATCH: Lt. Olivarez: Illegal Crossings Disrupt Navigation In Rio Grande, Not Marine Barriers
DPS Lieutenant Chris Olivarez joined Fox News last weekend where he pushed back on claims that Texas' floating marine barriers are causing navigational disruption in the Rio Grande River.
"The argument is that the marine barrier is causing navigational disruption in the river," said Lt. Olivarez. "If we really want to look at navigational disruption in the river, it's gonna be the fact that you have hundreds and hundreds of illegal immigrants crossing that river."
WATCH: DPS Troopers Discover Nine Illegal Immigrants Hidden In Sand Trailer

WATCH: Texas National Guard Deters Illegal Crossings In El Paso
Texas Army National Guard Specialist Aaron Holder provides a first-hand account of illegal immigration along the border in El Paso. Spc. Holder details how fencing and multiple layers of concertina wire deter illegal immigration and redirect migrants to legal ports of entry.
