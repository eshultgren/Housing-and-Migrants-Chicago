          Press Release
        
      
    
Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to more than 287,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 17,700 criminal arrests, with more than 15,100 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 325 million lethal doses throughout the state.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:
Governor Abbott Calls On NYC Mayor To Turn Attacks On President Biden’s Border Crisis
Governor Abbott issued a statement last Friday in response to New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ false accusations regarding Texas’ border mission to help local border communities by busing migrants to Washington, D.C. The mayor of sanctuary-city New York inaccurately claimed Texas was busing migrants there, creating a burden on New York City's resources.
“Mayor Adams’ problem is not with Texas. It is with President Biden’s refusal to stop this border crisis and secure our southern border,” said Governor Abbott. “A crisis that has overrun and overwhelmed our border towns and communities across our state, whose requests for help have gone ignored and unanswered by the Biden Administration.”

WATCH: DPS Lt. Olivarez Tells Fox News That NYC, D.C. Mayors Need To Voice Concerns To Federal Government
DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez joined Fox News’ Neil Cavuto to respond to criticism of Governor Abbott’s migrant busing mission, which has sent thousands of migrants to Washington, D.C. in an effort to provide relief to overrun border communities. He noted Governor Abbott has had to step in and provide the needed resources and tools to law enforcement agencies to combat smugglers and mass migration.
“If those mayors from New York and Washington, D.C. really want to get to the root cause of this whole situation, they need to voice their concerns to the federal government, which has completely neglected to secure the border,” said Lt. Olivarez. “Here at the southern border, we’ve been seeing 7,000 to 8,000 immigrants coming across every single day, and that’s overwhelming the limited resources of these smaller border communities such as Eagle Pass and Del Rio.”
 
WATCH: Texas Border Official Says Mayorkas Is Wrong, ‘Border Is Not Secure’
DPS Sgt. Marc Couch told Fox News that troopers are working diligently to combat criminal activities connected with human smuggling, fentanyl, and weapons trafficking across the southern border, which “is not secure,” contrary to President Biden’s claims. Sgt. Couch countered U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ comment last week that the border is secure. Fox News also notes senior DHS sources said the U.S. has seen nearly 900,000 known gotaways since the beginning of fiscal year 2021, with more than half a million since last October.
“The border is not secure when you’re seeing in the Rio Grande Valley sectors mass migration of people who are just wandering across the border,” said Sgt. Couch. “That is a misnomer of a statement that has no truth in it.”
