Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 473,900 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 34,800 criminal arrests, with more than 31,800 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law enforcement has seized over 431 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden’s open border policies.

Governor Abbott Announces Border Security On Third Special Session Agenda
Governor Abbott yesterday announced Special Session #3 and issued a proclamation identifying agenda items for the special session that begins Monday, October 9. Among other items, enhancing border security will be a major focus for the Texas Legislature to address in order to ensure the safety and security of Texans.
“Texas will also pass laws to mirror the federal immigration laws President Joe Biden refuses to enforce that will reduce illegal immigration and enhance the safety of Texans,” said Governor Abbott. “For the first time ever, Texas will subject people to arrest for illegal entry into our state from a foreign nation. All licensed law enforcement officers in Texas will be authorized to arrest or remove any person who illegally enters the State, with penalties up to 20 years in prison for refusing to comply with removal. To crack down on repeated attempts to enter Texas illegally, re-entry will be penalized with up to 20 years in prison.”

WATCH: Texas Rangers Special Operations Group Reclaims Island From Cartels
Newsmax border correspondent Jaeson Jones embedded with the Texas Rangers Special Operations Group on the 170-acre Fronton Island in the Rio Grande River for an up-close look at efforts to reclaim the island from transnational criminal organizations. DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez described law enforcement efforts on Fronton Island, including the use of DPS drones to scan the area and establishing security points on the island to prevent cartels from smuggling dangerous drugs like fentanyl, weapons, and high-interest criminals across the river into Texas.
“We’ve been talking about it for years, that’s why we have to look at it as a much broader issue than just immigration,” said Lt. Olivarez. “We need to focus on the threats, not only to public safety, but with a national security aspect and how close these cartels are operating to Texas. It validates every single piece of evidence of how these cartels are operating, not only in Mexico, but in the United States, especially in Texas.”
