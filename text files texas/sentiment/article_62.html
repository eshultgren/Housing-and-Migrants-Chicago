OLS Medic Goes Above And Beyond To Save Lives
 
Earlier this year, a medic with the Texas National Guard approached the scene of a vehicle accident in Edinburg while off-duty. The medic immediately pulled over and began assisting a police officer on the scene with providing care to the four children and two adults involved in the accident. 
 
"As I was coming up to the patients, there was a cop," said the Operation Lone Star medic. "He gave me his aid bag and I took everything out, trying to take care of the kids. Immediately when I saw children I was like, 'Oh my God - kids! We’ve got to save them.' So that was my main concern."
 
She immediately extracted the children from the vehicle and started to triage and render first aid. While both adults and the infant appeared unhurt, the three other children needed help. One child was unconscious, another suffered a head wound, and the third child had a black eye. The medic was able to revive the unconscious child and he appeared unhurt.
 
After performing first aid on the children, she monitored the victims until EMS arrived. Ten minutes later, she helped the EMTs move the victims into the ambulance.
