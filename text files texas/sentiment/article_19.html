Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 360,000 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 26,000 criminal arrests, with more than 24,000 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 380 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden's open border policies.
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:
Governor Abbott Champions Support For Border Patrol Agents In Houston
On Saturday, Governor Greg Abbott championed Texas' support for U.S. Border Patrol agents in their efforts to secure the border during the keynote address at the National Border Patrol Council Dinner in Houston. Addressing more than 220 agents and their families, the Governor thanked agents for their work to keep America safe and promised that Texas will always have their backs—even when the Biden Administration does not.
"America's Border Patrol agents are the unsung heroes of our country, putting your lives on the line each and every day to secure our border and uphold our nation's sovereignty,” said Governor Abbott. “Instead of defending you, Washington leaves you all undermanned and underpaid. I am here tonight to say thank you, let you know that Texas appreciates all you do to keep our country safe, and that you have a Governor who has your backs."
WATCH: DPS Lt. Olivarez Slams Biden Administration’s Inaction On Border Crisis
DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez joined Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo this week to highlight President Biden’s ongoing failure to secure America’s southern border following U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ recent refusal to acknowledge the crisis at a congressional hearing. Lt. Olivarez pointed out Secretary Mayorkas’ shocking ignorance of the wristbands Mexican cartels have used since 2021 on the illegal immigrants they smuggle across the border as an example of the Biden Administration’s negligence on America's national security.
“These Mexican drug cartels and smuggling organizations out of Mexico have essentially turned mass migration into a multibillion-dollar slave trade, and it’s all a result of these disastrous border policies from the federal government,” said Lt. Olivarez. “These wristbands have numbers on them, so it’s a very coordinated effort on the part of Mexican drug cartels and how they identify these people. Even if the migrants make it across the river and to their final destination, they’re still indebted to these [smuggling] organizations.”
