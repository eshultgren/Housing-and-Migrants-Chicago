Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to more than 297,200 migrant apprehensions and more than 19,000 criminal arrests, with more than 16,400 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 335.5 million lethal doses during this border mission.
Texas has also bused over 7,400 migrants to our nation's capital since April and over 1,500 migrants to New York City since August 5. The busing mission is providing much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.
RECENT HIGHLIGHTS FROM OPERATION LONE STAR:
WATCH: Governor Abbott Spotlights Migrant Busing To NYC, Dire Fentanyl Crisis
Governor Abbott joined America’s Newsroom on Fox News to spotlight New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ hypocrisy in complaining about bused migrants from Texas arriving in his sanctuary city. After the Governor invited Mayor Adams and Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to the border to see the crisis firsthand, the mayors have not accepted the invitation and refuse to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem.
“This is not a Texas problem; this is an American problem caused by the president,” said Governor Abbott. “We need more Americans to call on the president to uphold his oath of office and enforce the immigration laws of the United States.”
GOVERNOR ABBOTT: Eric Adams Is All Talk When It Comes To ‘Open’ Borders
In an op-ed for the New York Post this week, Governor Abbott called out Mayor Adams for boasting about his sanctuary city policies, while failing to live up to his campaign promises. Despite remaining silent when President Biden flew migrants to New York, the mayor is now condemning anyone who presses him to follow through on his ill-considered sanctuary city policies.
“Mayor Adams likes to sloganeer that ‘This is America’ and we need to start acting like it,” Governor Abbott writes. “We are a nation of laws. It’s time to start enforcing them. Doing that would restore the ‘humanity’ he is clamoring for.”

WATCH: Governor Abbott Points Out Mayor’s Political Games Amid Border Crisis
Governor Abbott joined Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow to discuss disastrous policies of Democrat leaders like President Biden's open border policies and New York Mayor Adams' hypocritical sanctuary city and the chaos they are creating at our southern border.
“The only reason we have all these people coming across the border is because of President Biden’s open border policies,” said Governor Abbott. “It was just two years ago we had record low numbers of people coming across the border illegally under President Trump because of the four policies he put in place that President Biden eliminated when he became president.”
