Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry. 
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 401,900 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 32,400 criminal arrests, with more than 29,600 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, Texas law enforcement has seized over 422 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.

Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden's open border policies.

Texas National Guard Sees Positive Impact From Turn-Back Strategy
Texas National Guard soldiers employ multiple strategies to turn back illegal immigrants, including installing triple-strand concertina wire, metal fencing, and land development and clearing in low river crossing areas. Soldiers and engineers have installed over 91 miles of concertina wire and more than 72 miles of metal fencing as part of Operation Lone Star.
As additional high-traffic routes for illegal crossings are identified, soldiers will continue to install barriers to deter illegal entry into Texas.
“The turn-back is the most consequential effect attained by the Guard and our law enforcement partners,” said Lt. Col. Johnny Guerrero, chief of staff for Joint Task Force Lone Star. “Our guardsmen are responsible for almost 47,000 turn backs since the inception of the mission in March 2021.”
