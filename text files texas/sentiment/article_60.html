          Press Release
        
      
    
Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.
Texas has bused:
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps created by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Joe Biden’s open border policies.

WATCH: DPS Lt. Olivarez: Federal Government Rewards Illegal Immigration
DPS Lieutenant Chris Olivarez joined Neil Cavuto on Fox News this week to explain that the federal government’s failure to enforce immigration laws—without consequences for illegal border crossings—will continue to attract mass migrant caravans to the US-Mexico border.
“There are no consequences from the federal government to prevent illegal border crossings,” said Lt. Olivarez. “As long as the federal government continues to incentivize and reward illegal immigration, we’re going to continue seeing these large caravans, these trains that are being used to transport these migrants further to the border to their entrance through Texas or Arizona—and those are the challenges we’re having to face as a state.”
