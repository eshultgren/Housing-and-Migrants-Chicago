          Press Release
        
      
    
Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard continue to work together to secure the border, stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas, and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry in response to the federal government's unwillingness to address the border crisis.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, multi-agency efforts have led to more than 239,849 migrant apprehensions, along with more than 14,364 criminal arrests — and more than 11,666 felony charges. Over 4,710 weapons and almost $37 million in currency have been seized. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 342 million lethal doses throughout the state.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.
