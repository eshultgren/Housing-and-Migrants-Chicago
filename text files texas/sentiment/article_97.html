Governor Greg Abbott, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and the Texas National Guard are continuing to work together to secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal behavior between ports of entry.
Since the launch of Operation Lone Star, the multi-agency effort has led to over 323,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 21,600 criminal arrests, with more than 19,200 felony charges reported. In the fight against fentanyl, DPS has seized over 350 million lethal doses of fentanyl during this border mission.
Texas has also bused almost 8,300 migrants to our nation's capital since April, over 3,700 migrants to New York City since August 5, and more than 1,200 migrants to Chicago since August 31. The busing mission is providing much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.
Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border. Every individual who is apprehended or arrested and every ounce of drugs seized would have otherwise made their way into communities across Texas and the nation due to President Biden's open border policies.

WATCH: Texas National Guard Soldiers Describe Border Operations In El Paso
As part of Operation Lone Star, the Texas National Guard recently expanded its area of operations to assist DPS in addressing the surge in illegal immigration and border activity in the El Paso region. Soldiers continue assisting DPS troopers in deterring and disrupting transnational criminal activity, such as human smuggling. Soldiers described one recent duty monitoring a storm drain where several illegal immigrants had been hiding.
“Success for us is close partnership with DPS and being able to quickly react to what their needs are for public safety,” said Col. Brian Fletcher, Operation Lone Star deputy commander of operations. “Success is in active deterrents, being able to observe, report, and improve the response time.”
“Having soldiers here helps to increase the amount of surveillance we can conduct on some of these areas so we can identify other smuggling locations,” said Jose Sanchez, DPS regional director in El Paso. “With the coordination with [the Texas Military Department] and DPS, we can identify some of the vehicle or groups that are crossing and easily intercept them.”
