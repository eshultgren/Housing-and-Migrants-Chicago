DP II Final




##Opioid Analysis
Opioid cases by zip code for 2020-2022 came from IDPH's Data Dashboard:

Encampment data is from HUD as well as supplemental eye-witness data collection: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Chicago-Encampment-Report.pdf
A major limitation in this analysis is the lack of encampment data. This does not capture the unhoused populations that seek shelter on CTA trains. Additionally, besides those included in the pdf, data was limited by the research team's confirmation of encampment locations and size. This means the only data collected is concentrated to areas where the research teams frequents.
High density areas were pulled from the Point-in-Time sampling methodology.

While it appears there are a concentration of encampments where rates of overdose are high, we are hesitant to make any claims of correlation due to the aforementioned limitations in data collection.
